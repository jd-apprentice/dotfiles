## ü§ù Contribute

- If you are not familiar with using git, github or anything similar you can start by going to their docs [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

- There are a lot of things that can be done better so if you have suggestions or want to contribute with something feel free to open a pull request for that you could follow the next steps

```bash
# In case you want to contribute with a new feature
$ git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# In case you want to fix something
$ git checkout -b fix/my-fix
```

then you are going to have to add your changes with

```bash
# For adding everything
$ git add .
# Then we commit the changes
$ git commit -m "Your message for this commit"
```

and for last remember to push your changes to the branch you are working on it.

```bash
# With this we are pushing to the remote repository
git push origin <your-branch>
```

- Then you open a pull request
- After your changes are reviewed and merged, you can delete your branch
