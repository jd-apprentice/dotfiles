# Why is there a readme here?

### Thats because i'm explaining something about this folder

- Because the theme thing is not completely self executable you will have to delete my own themes and change the `cp` routes since they are referenced for my themes

```bash
cp ./themes/ready2install/Ultimate-Maia-Black ~/.themes
cp ./themes/ready2install/Black-Maia-43 ~/.themes
cp ./themes/ready2install/Red-Maia ~/.icons
```

- Also another note to mention, is that we are ignoring the `ready2install` folder since it contains the extracted files for the themes and it can go up to 10k files.
